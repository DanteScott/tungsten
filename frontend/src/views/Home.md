# Welcome to Tungsten

Tungsten is a smart contract which helps in raising claimable-collateral or bonds, and it's developed by EOSMetal.
Tungsten is currently in MVP stage and we are going for a full launch in January next year.

## Mission

The mission of Tungsten is to achieve dApp layer governance, where different entities(dApps or BPs) could easily claim the bond placed if certain clauses mentioned in the Ricardian Contract are not followed.

## Vision

Helping EOS community securing their funds with help of bonds and licenses. Also automating the Dispute Resolution.

Using Tungsten any individual/dApp developer/Block Producer/Arbitrator could raise a collateral.
