## About Tungsten

Tungsten allows any entity or individual to raise a bond (collateral) with a set of claimable clauses (promises with defined penalties). A bond issuer could choose/mention any arbitration forums to handle the disputes (opt-in) and select the time frame of the bond.

In case of any disputes, an individual could claim against the bond. He would need to specify the bond hash and claim value (penalty). The smart contract allows an arbitrator to put the rulings on-chain and if the ruling is in favor of the claimant, contract transfers the funds to claimant from the bond.

## How would it help EOS Ecosystem?

The bond acts like escrow and could help with establishing trust within the community members. The contract shifts the dispute resolution away from any influence of Block Producers or any centralized entity. Also, it makes the awards by Arbitrator self-enforceable without the need of intervention from Block Producers.

## Road Ahead!

Tungsten is a small step towards the bigger goal of making EOS network dApplications trusted and secure for mainstream adoption with the flexibility of opting own set of rules.

### Register Arbitrator and Forums.

Including EOS NewYork proposal `{regarb}` and `{regarbforum}` into Tungsten.

### Public Forums

Forums are important to have on-chain evidence by the claimant (if possible) and awards by Arbitrators. Forums could help with two majors functions:

1. Filtering arbitrators based on awards and resolved disputes documents.
2. Filtering claims, which could help with analysing the health of arbitration ecology and help with updating clauses for bonds.

### Ricardian Contract Auditors/Smart Contract Auditors

If Bonds are widely used the majority of dApplication owners will look for security auditing of contracts before deploying them. Ricardian contract and Smart Contract will be needed to be then reviewed and rated by the Auditors.
The rating and reviews by trusted auditors will help with standardizing the bond dApplication accordingly.
We are actively reaching out to Third Party Auditing Companies looking to establish business on EOS blockchain.

### Certification

To safeguard users to give illusory consent to the business owner we feel certificates (licenses) based on auditing of RC and Smart-Contract could help to distinguish the good bond dApplications from self-preference bonds dApplication.
Block Producers are very well known within the community and steward the community towards using the right set of tools. The idea behind introducing certificates/licenses is to help audited bonds and smart contracts with high visibility and more trust within community members using the tools endorsed by Block Producers.

### EOSMetal and BPs Bonds!

EOSMetal will be the first user of Tungsten and will deploy its own bonds which could be claimed by any user voting us. We hope many other Block Producers will join our initiative and raise similar bonds. The set of promises made by Block Producers governed by free market forces will provide the flexibility for stakeholders in terms of governance.

## FAQs

### What are Bonds and why they are important for EOS ecosystem?

The bonds are the collateral raised against a set of promises (clauses defined) bundled with the Ricardian contract which could be claimed in case of any disputes and are legally binding. The arbitrator powers are just limited to bonds.

The bond structure helps shifting the governance structure from Protocol layer to dApp-layer. Also, Bonds could help with automation of disputes on dApp layer.

### How bond based dispute resolution is different?

Any individual or entity could raise a bond specifying an arbitration forum/arbitrator, also any arbitrator could register itself as Arbitrator raising bond (mentions check and balances).

For Instance, Alice runs a business X, raises bond and mentions ECAF. Bob have a dispute with Alice, he files claim in ECAF, arbitrator looks at dispute and give an award in favor of Bob. Bob receives money from the bond

### How does the bond based Arbitration help with Automation?

Much like Ebay, arbitration could take a staircase approach once we have tokens stored as Escrow. Any claimant need to put piece of evidence on the Arbitration forums, which could be further analysed and mediated (based on data collected after many iteration of similar claims) with the help of software. Only if the case remains unresolved will need human intervention.

### How will arbitrator get paid?

The parties in dispute will pay the arbitrator fees based on pre agreed contract.

Do any one need to pay for raising a Bond?

We are providing the service for free in the initial days (by BP rewards). Looking forward for ideas from community to make it self-sustainable project without putting much cost on individual or entities trying to raise bond.
